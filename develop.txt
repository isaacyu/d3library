		error in line 642 because dimension is empty
		
		it is empty because on line 593, it is created by 
			thisGraph.circles.enter()
            .append("g");
			
			what thisGraph is? is an object constructed by GraphCreator, with circle, nodes, ... as attribute
			
			but its rects attribute is empty.
			
			there must be something that circle has done but not rect.
			
			I find in line 581, it is updated:
				thisGraph.circles = thisGraph.circles.data(thisGraph.nodes, function(d) {
					return d.id;
				});
				thisGraph.circles.attr("transform", function(d) {
					return "translate(" + d.x + "," + d.y + ")";
				});
				
			what is the structure of a node?
				in html, svg, g, g(2nd), g (many node), node or text
			
			why circles has enter, but not rects? (line 597: 
			    var newGs = thisGraph.rects.enter()
					.append("g");	
		
		newGs is not empty, but its members are "null"
		
    
    14 aug
		carify: what are standard steps of displaying circle, rects, edges

		it seems I should add rect in create, not in update

		how to get the information of "d" used in circle?
        
        
    
	14 aug
		why dragging will make error in console, dimension with length 0?
	
	
	13 aug
		track index
			I guess these are just setting of routine code
				graph-creator.js, line 650: var graph = new GraphCreator(svg, nodes, edges,setting);
				
				graph-creator.js, line 5: var GraphCreator = function(svg, nodes, edges,setting)
					constructor of graph
				
				graph-creator.js, line 25: var defs = svg.append('svg:defs');
					svg is a svg tag (<svg> ... some code ... </svg>) created by d3 in line: 647
					svg.append('svg:defs') will append 
					
					question: is svg equal to d3.svg?
				
			I guess this step tell how svg is draw:
				graph-creator.js, line 654: graph.updateGraph();
				
			Steps are as follows:
				graph-creator.js, line 512: GraphCreator.prototype.updateGraph = function() 
			
			* This line responsible for inserting circle
			    graph-creator.js, line 586,7:     
					newGs.append("circle")
						.attr("r", String(consts.nodeRadius));
				
				After remove circle, the listener attached to circle also not added, hence the graph is not draggable now.
				
			* This line responsible for inserting text
			    graph-creator.js, line 589-591:
					newGs.each(function(d) {
						thisGraph.insertTitleLinebreaks(d3.select(this), d.title);
					});
				
			* I have modified the code, so that the function: thisGraph.insertTitleLinebreaks will return the dimension of the text
				in line: 256, last line of "GraphCreator.prototype.insertTitleLinebreaks = function(gEl, title) {"
			
			* Since adding the text first then rect will make rect cover the text, I make a seperated function to get the width without really adding text
			

		Circle is conceptG?

		
	12 aug
		Remove circle
			Where does the code place circle?
			Line 555 and few lines after
			
		not only circle, but text also removed
			nodes is stored in line 623
		
		text are inserted in line 584

	10 Aug
		change node size by code
			node size is contral by "consts.nodeRadius"
			which is defined in line 192, GraphCreator.prototype.consts
			I change it setting in graphSetting.js line 1
		
		replace circle by retangle
			circle is added on
